# BlueTooth Helper
I wanted a utility to help me copy files form my old (non-smart) phone. The only way I could find to tranfer files was by using bluetooth push, however, Windows' built in bluetooth file tranfer dialog only allows one tranfter at a time making this excersize rather tedious. This utility allowed me to proceed much faster.
