# BlueTooth Helper
I wanted a utility to help me copy files form my old (non-smart) phone. The only way I could find to transfer files was by using bluetooth push, however, Windows' built in bluetooth file transfer dialog only allows one transfer at a time making this exercise rather tedious. This utility allowed me to proceed much faster.
